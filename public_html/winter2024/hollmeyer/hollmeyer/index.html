	<h1><strong>Sargassum</strong></h1>
<h2>by Jenn Hollmeyer </h2>
  
<p>Dark tape spills from the spools like sargassum washing up on the shore. We recorded these songs right off the radio, 
	the announcer&rsquo;s words becoming part of the lyrics forever in our minds. Here&rsquo;s one I know youâ€™ll remember. 
	This one goes out to you. The next one&rsquo;s for the Friday lunch crowd. Cue the applause track. We thought there 
	was a real party. We thought we were missing out. Someday we&rsquo;d have a way to get there and we&rsquo;d hear our voices 
	on the air. Someday someone would dedicate something to us. Sargassum sounds like sarcasm, a jockey in a soundproof 
	studio, spinning an ocean of aspiration and releasing it in waves. </p>

<p>When they&rsquo;re gone, line the little drawer with a scrap of paper from the roll your mother used to wrap your birthday 
	gifts, back when she still gave you birthday gifts. Lay down the plastic dime-store lamb you inherited from 
	your grandmother&rsquo;s collection. Put its head on a pinch of cotton from your aspirin bottle, and tuck it in with a 
	square cut from the want ads. Close the drawer with one finger, and place the box high on the kitchen shelf so 
	the next time you need to burn something, you&rsquo;ll remember that your fire comes from sacrifice, that when you strike 
	your origin story against itself, it consumes you even while it lights your path. </p>
