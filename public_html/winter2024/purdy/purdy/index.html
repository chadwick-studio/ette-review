	<h1><strong>Sitting Room and Woodshed (The “Lost” Nutshell)</strong></h1>
<h2>by Jessica Purdy</h2>
<p>
—Deceased: Eugene Black, town drunkard. Questioned: Winifred Black, his daughter.</p>
<p>Reported October 25th, 1947</p>

<p>Rage. White noise of gunshot Westerns. Radio stories and finally, silence. I’m hearing the <br>
ringing. After his bender. The black phone off the hook. Dial. Tone. Of voice. My father, the <br>
known town drunk. Yells before blackout. Snores before dying. Blasted. Plastered. Loaded. <br>
Delirium drowned out by white noise of gunshot Westerns. Rifle hung on spikes. The woodshed <br>
sawdust on his shoes. On the sunrise patterned linoleum. The wood stove kindling scattered. A <br>
couch armrest cracked. Father fallen back. To sleep or death. Whichever one groans. Drones on <br>
and on. Dangerous drunk. I’m overwhelmed. Juggling jobs. While he drank, I worked and took <br>
care of mother. Mother out of earshot. Muffled shouts. White noise of gunshot Westerns. Radio. <br>
Telephone. Rifle report. A little liquor left in the bottle. The dog points its muzzle towards the <br>
afterlife. The hidden scent of blood.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>This poem is named after one of Frances Glessner Lee’s "Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death." Originally, 
there were twenty “Nutshells,” which Lee meticulously crafted. These crime scene dioramas were meant to help police officers 
hone their observation skills. One Nutshell has been destroyed, and "Woodshed and Sitting Room" had been missing for 
decades until it was discovered in 2005 in a storage area of Lee's summer home at The Rocks in New Hampshire. 
In my chapbook <span class="italic">The Adorable Knife</span>, it is my intention to honor Frances Glessner Lee’s own attention to detail in 
crafting these, as well as to imagine possible “solutions” by giving voice to the stories told in the crime scenes. 
The poem appearing here in <span class="italic">-ette</span> does not appear in my chapbook, and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to share it.
