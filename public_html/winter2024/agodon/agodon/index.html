	<h1><strong>Another Way to Say Divorce</strong></h1>
	<h2>by Kelli Russell Agodon</h2>

<p class="justify">At the grocery store, the woman told 
her <br>
children, <span class="italic">I&rsquo;m selling daddy to the circus</span>. But<br>
what she meant to say was that his eyes<br>
were the color of tigers, the color of the<br>
flaming rings he tried to make her jump through.<br>

	<h1><strong>Box Where Four Women Look in Opposite Directions</strong></h1>

	<h2>by Kelli Russell Agodon<h2>

	<p>It&rsquo;s not a sunset, but the earth turning away<br> 
from a star. Behind walls, we cultivate love.<br>
There&rsquo;s always a little sadness in empty bottles.<br>
The woman to my left is ripping up the<br>
directions. The woman to my right has glued a <br>
map onto her life. We are hungry and time is<br> 
running out. In every disaster, there is a purple <br>
flower that survives. Sometimes what grows is<br>
a memory, a thread of self we once were.<br>
Sometimes we wear an old shirt and come unsewn.
