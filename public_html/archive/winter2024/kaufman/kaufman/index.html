<h1><strong>Bodies Up Ahead</strong></h1>
	<h2>Marc Kaufman</h2>
	<p>
	He hadn&rsquo;t worn a suit in three years—not since his father&rsquo;s funeral—and in that time, he&rsquo;d gained 
		just enough weight to make the sleeves and the shoulders tight, the waist constrict. 
		A life selling office furniture to companies in Tokyo. <p></p>
	The train raced forward.</p> 
	<p></p>
<p>At each stop, even when it seemed another person couldn&rsquo;t find their way in, 
	another did. Then another. Trains were instruments of time, of speed and 
	more speed, made by those bound to their limits. </p>
<p>The lights of the next underground station flickered. There was still a transfer to make, a distance to run. </p>
<p><span class="italic">After 9:00, the office is too busy. </span>Their words.</p>
<p>His father had loved walking to work or riding his bicycle. <span class="italic">Avoid the trains at all costs. Never live too far from where you work.</span> People, he said, were complex Swiss movements, needing constant motion to stay wound. When he was young, his father&rsquo;s phrases, so often repeated, sounded frail—echoing in the desperate way one generation talks to the next. </p>
<p>The train pulled into Yoyogi Koen station. At each of the doors, thirty or more pushed, ready to pack in. It was the whole city, a mass of force, singular in their purpose. They wanted where he was, all of them. They wanted to be on their way. They wanted to begin. They wouldn&rsquo;t stop wanting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That night, when asked, he would tell Haruna, <span class="italic">I didn&rsquo;t make it in time. The train stopped because there was a body up ahead. What could I have done? </span>The doors began to open, the music began to play, the mob began to come. 
	And then the push of summer air—stale but so alive he couldn’t resist. </p>
