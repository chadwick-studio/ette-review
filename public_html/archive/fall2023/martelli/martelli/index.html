<h1><strong>Forever Jung</strong></h1>

<h2>by Jennifer Martelli</h2>

<p>At a little bistro across from the beach, my friend gave her name for a table: <span class="italic">Young</span>, she said, <span class="italic">party of two.</span> The host asked, <span class="italic">Do you spell that with a Y or a J?</span> I loved that it mattered. That we were all in the collective dream. Long ago, when I was pregnant, I had a therapist who was a Jungian. He laughed that my son would be the Archer, a <span class="italic">Saâ„¥</span>, he said, drawing out that soft G that could be a J. Like most intellectual men, he wore a turtleneck and elbow-patched blazer in falling leaf colors: aged wines and golds. My friend&mdash;Young&mdash;asked if she should see a therapist. Her family was small, yet caused such pain. I could see the Civil War statue over her shoulder, out the window, where it was raw. The sea had sprayed over the wall to the sidewalk; off-shore storms stirring up a red pulp that dried on the ground. I&rsquo;ll tell you, all of this came true: my son was born in Sagittarius and I would dream of archers, of letters shaped like hooks. I would dream of buying my friend sweet hot coffee.</p>

<h1><strong>Linden Leaves</strong></h1>

<h2>by Jennifer Martelli</h2>

<p>My mother&rsquo;s final roommate on the memory floor was Tina, whose son brought Italian playing cards to lay on her lap: angel, world, moon, moors, gourds. The sundowning made her and my mother see shapes in the linden leaves: shadows, faces, ghosts, old lovers. The nurse would close the shades before dusk fell, before they would walk the halls with dinner trays of pureed food: what was once green beans, what was once cows&rsquo; liver, what was beets, what was kidney beans. Before long, he dealt a hand to me, too. I lied, said I could play tarocchino but lost my queen, my cavalier, my jack, my fool. Never had time to learn the rules. I ran out the clock, the dusk, the cups, the linden leaves, too.</p>
