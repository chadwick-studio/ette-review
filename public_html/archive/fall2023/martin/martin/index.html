            ‘tis the season: his mother calls as we put up our own tree (December). Neighbors' blue holiday lights: the dry heat season, early morning nose bleed (November). At the top of Crown Street: 
the leaves atop the tree go golden (October). I board the bus (September). Watching through windows: fawn become deer (August). The dog’s bark annoys: because your inner thought wants to sound out else wise (July). Summer camp kids line up to fly inside to a marquee feature (June). The way I was held onto by you: he holds onto his pillow (May). Each morning at the funeral home the steps are swept (April). Birds go up as snow comes down (March). If only up an hour earlier, I would have seen far fewer cars on the work walk (February). How many inches of this whiteness with nothing green to tell (January).</p>
