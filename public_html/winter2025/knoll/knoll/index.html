<h1><strong>The Only Explanation</strong></h1>

<h2>by Tricia Knoll</h2>

<p>In dawn’s light I see footprints retreating from my house in thin snowfall this November day. Boot size 12 at least.</p>

<p>In the Professor’s <span class="italic">Explanation of Phenomena</span>, page 32, at the end of his chapter on Disappearances, he describes the work of Feasties – those who stuff themselves with dreams, gobble so fast without regard to choking, that they suffuse their bodies with heat even unto their feet. He hypothesizes that they also nibble away the words aging people forget.</p>

<p>The Professor says they perform this service free of charge, but he could not say what benefit this was to the Feasties, only that they could not live without brainwaves.</p>

<p>About one thing he was right. Their footsteps melted by noon.</p>
