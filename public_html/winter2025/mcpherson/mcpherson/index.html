<h1><strong>Telepathy</strong></h1>

<h2>by Karen McPherson</h2>

<p>we were nineteen and he said we could read each other’s minds
    and I couldn’t but pretended to believe in that bright highway
    stretching through the air between us that splinter of intention
    drilling its way through the bone of our two skulls a thought a
    vision shared as he stared at me from across the room, said <span class="italic">feel it?</span>
    and I didn’t but nodded yes because this was how we made
    the world what we imagined it to be <span class="italic">here comes the sun</span> he sang
    and I closed my eyes keeping in the light holding in the shadows
