  <h1><strong>If I Could Remake the World</strong></h1>

  <h2>by Andrew Bertaina</h2>

  <p>
    Before you left, we used to play this game, if I could remake the world,
    we’d populate these imaginary worlds with the silliest things—topiaries of
    candy, sexually indiscriminate walruses, melancholic trees, weeping in the
    breeze. Now that you’re gone, sometimes I still play the game, late at
    night, when my daughter is asleep, as a kind of waking meditation, a last
    thread of connection. If I could remake the world, from first flicker of
    light piercing ether, to finishing the paper-thin wings of a gnat, I’d start
    by adding more land, more snowy crags, more windswept valleys rich with
    mangoes, more aspens quaking in the breeze. The land would stretch on
    forever, so people could search for themselves by getting lost—a northwest
    passage, a new species of hooded woodpecker, a ruined city covered by ivy in
    the deep, hot jungle.
  </p>

  <p>
    As for male and female, I wouldn’t pull the rib from Adam as God did, I’d
    create both from dust. Only, I’d create numerous people, multifarious, to
    avoid the difficult question of how much incest it took for our species to
    spread out across that vast landscape of diaphanous rivers and
    flower-swathed plains. I don’t know whether I’d make emperor penguins in the
    precise way they are now, but rather, I’d give them a hat, round and small
    as the pontiff’s and make them enigmatic spiritual leaders as opposed to
    flightless birds. But perhaps this world has already gotten off track and
    must be started again, as God did, wiping the slate clean with acidic
    oceans, volcanic eruptions, and asteroids falling into the Yucatan
    Peninsula.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’d start then with water. Everything would be water—turquoise water, blue
    water, green waters, dark and deep waters. And I’d create two whales, both
    asexual, so there would be no question of future sadness. The two whales,
    picture something like a cross between a blue and a humpback, would be
    immortal, and they’d swim through the depths of the sea for eternity with
    nothing to see, except one another, powering through the water like freight
    trains carrying the dreams of a better world.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can already hear your objection, think of all the complexity lost by only
    having two whales. What would we do in a world where Becky Hanson doesn’t
    invite us to her fourth-grade birthday party or Doug Jones doesn’t kiss that
    girl in a shimmering green dress we’ve been mooning over all year? What will
    we do in a world with no tender cherry blossoms coated in bells of rain? No
    raucous bird song, no power lines cleaving sky, no loves and lovers
    exchanging texts, envelopes of light stretching through the darkness of a
    failing relationship. No ballet recitals, pink tutus, and childish fits. No
    long drives with the radio blaring and tears streaming down our faces as we
    look towards the hills at a sky of orange fire.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don’t worry, dearest, given an eternity, these whales would play out all our
    human dramas, dream all our dreams, write and discard Shakespeare’s sonnets, <span
      class="italic">The Essays</span
    > of Montaigne, <span class="italic">The Histories</span> of Herodotus, the disastrous
    last season of <span class="italic">Game of Thrones</span>, they’d be
    enemies, boss and applicant, gardener and soil, father and son, husband and
    scorned lover.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, my love, if you’re still reading, I’d create a world only slightly
    like this one. You and I would still be there and maybe those two whales.
    We’d be otter-like creatures with webbed feet, webbed eyes, a penchant for
    wry jokes, and rye whiskey. We’d swim in the Adriatic, slither between the
    ruins of cities that never were, the Greek Isles, the abandoned arm of the
    Colossus of Rhodes. We’d watch the dreams of those whales start the long
    journey upriver, lumbering along to spawn the world to come.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’d swim across molten gold water towards the half-orb of the sun. In this
    world, the light will be something you can attach yourself to, like a belay,
    and we’ll be so close together, as we once were, in a Florentine spring.
  </p>

  <p></p>

  <p>
    Of course, that world doesn’t exist yet because I haven’t created it. In
    this one, I’m looking at a painting, red and pink with flecks of white that
    could be birds, snowflakes, blossoms. In this one, life is different, but I
    still leave the couch, slip off my clothes, and walk into the painting. The
    pink, red, and white colors, flow past me like veils, like long and silken
    hair.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this world, I’m swimming towards the horizon. Mid-way, I realize I’ll
    never make it, but I keep swimming anyway, like those goddamn stupid otter
    things in the other world. Or like we did that last fateful summer when our
    relationship was over, but we still traveled to Spain, drank wine and ate
    snails, fought in the moonlit square, made furious love and got drunk until
    we both ceased to exist, which was the only way we could go on—playing in
    the ashes of our relationship as children in the sand.
  </p>

  <p>
    I swim because swimming through a painting filled with a piercing white
    light is to give life a meaning it so rarely has. And isn’t that the thing
    which bothered you most? That I couldn’t put a name to anything, to how I
    felt for you, us or myself, about a little house, a little dog, the names of
    our future children?
  </p>

  <p>
    I could write like this for hours, but unlike God, I don’t have an eternity.
    I have a few moments at the end of the day to bring order to the swirling
    chaos. So I sit with my daughter, you still absent. I open a page in her
    coloring book, there is a princess, wide-eyed and innocent on her way to
    attend a ball. My daughter and I sit, side by side, drawing the princess’s
    dress in with royal purple. Neither of us says a word, but you can feel
    between our two warm and breathing bodies, a kind of connection, of furious
    work, of love.

  <h1><strong>My Lover and I</strong></h1>

  <h2>by Andrew Bertaina</h2>

  <p>
    My lover and I, we have but one minor difference, easily insurmountable. She
    says that she’d like to do everything together, and I suggest, in
    opposition, that we do nothing. For her, these two modes of thinking are
    incompatible. But I tell her that our ideas can meet in the ideal
    Aristotelian mean. Imagine, I said, how two parallel lines seem to converge
    at the vanishing point.
  </p>

  <p>
    She says she doesn’t much care for the golden mean, that my ideas are
    absurd. I say that Kafka wrote a story about a man who turned into a bug.
    But that wasn’t the absurd part, the man turned into a full-grown cockroach.
    Rather, the absurd part, if you thought about it, was that we were still
    reading his story one hundred years later in classrooms across the United
    States of America, which, given Kafka’s wishes, is more absurd than a man
    turning himself into a bug. She says no man has ever actually turned into a
    bug and that I put too much faith in my own intellect.
  </p>

  <p>
    She said I was losing the thread of the argument. I suggested that we watch
    Netflix from our separate apartments, that we fall asleep with FaceTime
    turned on, that we tag each other in photos on Instagram for places we visit
    separately. I have workable solutions, flow charts. She says that I’ve
    misunderstood, not only her but art. The point is that the two lines only
    “seem” to converge. In the distance, she sees a wide-open space, no lines
    for miles.
