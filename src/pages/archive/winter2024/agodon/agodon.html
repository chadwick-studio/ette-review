	<h1><strong>Another Way to Say Divorce</strong></h1>
	<h2>by Kelli Russell Agodon</h2>
	
<p class="justify p1">
At the grocery store, the woman told her 
children, <span class="italic">I&rsquo;m selling daddy to the circus</span>. But
what she meant to say was that his eyes
were the color of tigers, the color of the
flaming rings he tried to make her jump through.

	<h1><strong>Box Where Four Women Look in Opposite Directions</strong></h1>

	<h2>by Kelli Russell Agodon<h2>

	<p class="justify p2">It&rsquo;s not a sunset, but the earth turning away
from a star. Behind walls, we cultivate love.
There&rsquo;s always a little sadness in empty bottles.
The woman to my left is ripping up the
directions. The woman to my right has glued a 
map onto her life. We are hungry and time is 
running out. In every disaster, there is a purple 
flower that survives. Sometimes what grows is
a memory, a thread of self we once were.
Sometimes we wear an old shirt and come unsewn.</span>
