<h1><strong>When We Write Our Lives Sometimes the Paragraphs are Uneven</strong></h1>
    
<h2>by Susan Rich</h2>
    
<p>Sometimes the world’s paragraph begins with a question mark, and proceeds into long quotations on the subject of invertebrates, and figs. A woman reads the world’s first paragraph as she hipsways her infant and inhales the ocean, spitting it out into miniature islands. She unscrews her plum-colored pen and writes. <span class="italic">Am I good enough, will I ever think I’m good enough?</span> She hates the word <span class="italic">good</span>, tries out, <span class="italic">Will I ever be guitar fish enough? Will I ever be equinox enough?</span> This is a thesaurus of her own making found in a hotel room, long after the guests have gone.</p>
