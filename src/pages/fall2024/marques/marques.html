<h1><strong>Rallentando</strong></h1>
    
<h2>by Amy Marques</h2>
    
<p>Nan could no longer play. But her blue-haired granddaughter agreed to take her to the once beautiful brick schoolhouse that housed the first piano Nan had ever touched. It was still there: in a corner, the middle C missing its ivory, and two strings curling out like wiry white hairs.</p>
    
<p>Nan’s hair was smooth today, but she’d had to pause her brushing three times this morning. One day you’re allegro, presto, keeping pace, daydreaming of how someday you’ll pause to just be. What nobody tells you is that when someday finally comes, being takes all the time you have left.</p>
