<h1><strong>What Ophelia Did</strong></h1>
    
<h2>by Bryana Joy</h2>
    
<p>Ophelia drowned herself (which is a sin) but was out of her mind (which couldn’t be helped). Inside her mind a man holding a tuba was making a terrible noise. Two others gave her orders that did not agree. Be a table said one. God damn you said the other. Be a chair. She couldn’t live there. While the moon was out she crawled through the grass snapping each stalk she came for. She weighed both sins and then picked.</p>

<h1><strong>What Audrey One Did</strong></h1>
    
<h2>by Bryana Joy</h2>
    
<p>Audrey showed up late and Mr. Mushnik was drumming his fingers on the counter. She was always doing what would make you squirm: Spilling I’m Sorries like something with a leak. Shaking like a sheet of paper as she powdered a purple eye. In only a minute her leopard print was hobbling behind the mop. Her toes were screaming but she shushed them. She knew how much a girl was like a sheet of paper. One blot and you had to throw the whole thing out.</p>
