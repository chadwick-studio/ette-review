<h1><strong>Holy Oil</strong></h1>

<h2>by Laurin Becker Macios</h2>

<p>That August I put three drops on my tongue. Dangerous: do not ingest. They bloomed into answers as right and objective as clouds offering rain. The way Danielle said <span class="italic">I just can’t wait to walk outside into that storm and meant it</span>, her craving for cleansing undeniable. I put three drops on my tongue and it was like that. All uncertainty left me, all memory of uncertainty left me. My mind was a pillow I could rest my head on. All memory of pain left me, but I wasn’t numb, I was a vessel bristling with everything imaginary, everything real—rocks in their miraculous formations, the ocean lapping the shore like an uninhibited lover. It came in a tiny glass bottle, clear as crystal, clear as the liquid inside, you’d almost think nothing was there, and you wouldn’t be wrong—the nothing’s power was in its nothing. Like air had been prescribed, but the drops were real—plink plink plink. The absolving: a violin playing itself in a sculpture garden I remember vividly but have not seen.</p>
