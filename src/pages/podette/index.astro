    <h2>Cassette</h2>

    <p>Etymology:</p>

    <p>
      1793, "a little box," from French <span class="italic">cassette</span>,
      from a diminutive of Old North French casse "box" (see case (n.2). Meaning
      "magnetic tape cartridge" is from 1960.
    </p>
    <br />
    <span class="bold">case (n.2)</span>

    <p>
      "Receptacle, box, that which encloses or contains," early 14c., from
      Anglo-French and Old North French <span class="italic">casse</span> (Old French
      <span class="italic">chasse</span> "case, reliquary;" Modern French <span
        class="italic">châsse</span
      >), from Latin <span class="italic">capsa</span> "box, repository" (especially
      for books), from <span class="italic">capere</span> "to take, hold" (from PIE
      root *kap- "to grasp"). The meaning "outer protective covering" is from late
      14c. Also used from 1660s with a sense of "frame" (as in staircase, casement).
      Artillery sense is from 1660s, from case-shot "small projectiles put in cases"
      (1620s). Its application in the printing trade (first recorded 1580s) to the
      two shallow wooden trays where compositors keep their types in compartments
      for easy access led to upper-case for capital letters (1862), so called from
      its higher position on the compositor's sloped work-table, and lower-case for
      small letters.
