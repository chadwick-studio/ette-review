Nutshell Note:

This poem is named after one of Frances Glessner Lee’s "Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death." Originally, 
there were twenty “Nutshells,” which Lee meticulously crafted. These crime scene dioramas were meant to help police officers 
hone their observation skills. One Nutshell has been destroyed, and "Woodshed and Sitting Room" had been missing for 
decades until it was discovered in 2005 in a storage area of Lee's summer home at The Rocks in New Hampshire. 
In my chapbook "The Adorable Knife," it is my intention to honor Frances Glessner Lee’s own attention to detail in 
crafting these, as well as to imagine possible “solutions” by giving voice to the stories told in the crime scenes. 
The poem appearing here in -ette does not appear in my chapbook, and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to share it.
